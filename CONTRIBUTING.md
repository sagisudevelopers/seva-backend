The Seva By Sagisu project operates an open contributor model where anyone is welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for contributing.

There are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for merging pull requests and release cycles.

Getting Started :
New contributors are very welcome and needed.
Reviewing and testing is highly valued and the most effective way you can contribute as a new contributor. It also will teach you much more about the code and process than opening pull requests. 
Before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the codebase. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to install and run the application.

If you're looking for somewhere to start contributing, check out the good first issue list. Some of them might no longer be applicable.So if you are interested, but unsure, you might want to leave a comment on the issue first.

Good First Issue Label :
The purpose of the good first issue label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.
However, good first issues can be solved by anyone. If they remain unsolved for a longer time, a frequent contributor might address them.
You do not need to request permission to start working on an issue. However, you are encouraged to leave a comment if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.
 
Communication Channels :
 
 


Contributor Workflow :
The codebase is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone without exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests" (PRs). This facilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.
To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:
1) Fork and clone the repository (Only for the first time)
2) Do the development work and sync repository whenever necessary
3) Push changes to your forked repository
4) Create pull request
5) Merged into main repository after review or will be asked for bug fix/changes in feature

Merging a PR (maintainers only)
A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer if:

1) It is passing test cases
2) It has no requested changes.
3) It is up to date with current master.
Any maintainer is allowed to merge a PR if all of these conditions are met.

Shipping a release (maintainers only) : 
Each preparation to release should have a draft release note. Once the release is reviewed and approved, the release note should move to the prod release notes section.

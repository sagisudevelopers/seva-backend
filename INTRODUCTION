Seva by sagisu is an open source project for helping the community during this pandemic situation. Our application provides information about hospital bed availability for all the bed types and also lets users make reservations in the hospitals. We also let service providers put in the services they offer which can help users to find the services they need.We started it in Banglore with an intention to extend it to other cities.

Hospitals can integrate with us to accept bookings for the beds. Each tied up hospital will get portal access where they can view the booking requests along with an option to accept or reject the booking.
